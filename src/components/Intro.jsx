      <h2>What is a story beat?</h2>
      <p>In film development terms, a “story beat” refers to a single story event which transforms the character and story at a critical juncture. Think of beats as “checkpoints” along the way, that will complete the story and chart out a film structure.</p>
      <p>In his book “Save the Cat,” screenwriter Blake Snyder boiled film plot structure down to 15 beats. He also includes the suggested page number each beat should should occur on. We included those on our Save the Cat beat sheet template.</p>
      <p>Here you can see how each of these story beats plays out visually.</p>
